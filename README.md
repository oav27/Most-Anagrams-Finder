# Most-Anagrams-Finder In Java
Final Project Created Based on Learnings of Data Structures.

---

## Preview:

This was the capstone project of my Data Structures in Java class at Columbia. It was a project that was meant to utilize almost all of our learnings over the semester. While I am very proud of my code,  

***as I say with absolute honesty and humility that I recieved a perfect grade on this project***,   

I cannot publicly share my code for this project or the course material given. Posting my code or course material would be violating my school's Academic Honesty Policy, as this project could be a future assignment for students taking this class in the future.

With all that being said, ***below is a quick summary of what the project should accomplish. Please enjoy!***

## - Message for Recruiters  

If you are a recruiter or company that would like to see or go over my code with me, I would be more than estatic to share it with you privately. Please message me on LinkedIn (located in my GitHub bio) or right here on GitHub. Thank you!

## Objective

Using several data structures and a sorting algorithm, I developed a program that finds the word or words with the most anagrams. The project was accomplished with proper object-oriented programming techniqures, specifically polymorphism. I also timed my program's execution times and analyzed their run times to analyze how each data structure performed.
